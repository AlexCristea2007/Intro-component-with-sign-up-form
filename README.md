# Form Validation with Custom Error Handling
This project demonstrates how to implement dynamic form validation for a sign-up form. The JavaScript code handles input validation with custom error messages and feedback for fields such as name, email, and password.

## Features
Dynamic Error Handling: Provides real-time validation feedback for name, email, and password fields.

### Custom Validation Patterns:

Name: Only allows alphabetic characters, hyphens, and spaces, with a minimum of two characters.

Email: Validates the email format.

Password: Ensures the password includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character, with a minimum length of 8 characters.

Error Messages: Displays custom error messages for invalid input or empty fields.

## Tech Stack
JavaScript: Handles input validation and error message updates dynamically.

HTML & CSS: For the form structure and styling (from the previous HTML/CSS code provided).
